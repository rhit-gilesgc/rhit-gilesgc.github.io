        <p>
            Learn, solve problems, repeat. My passion in life is to learn about concepts and apply them in order to solve problems.
            Through my education at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I plan to gain an excellent computer science degree in order to be prepared for the tech-dense future.
        </p>

        <p>
            An education in computer science is something that I have been aiming for almost my entire life. I have a passion for computer security and blockchain
            development, things that I hope to satisfy and develop through my learning endeavor.
